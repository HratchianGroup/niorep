# Natural Ionization Orbitals

### Introduction

A compact orbital representation of ionization processes is described utilizing the difference of calculated one-particle density matrices. Natural orbital analysis involving this difference density matrix simplifies interpretation of electronic detachment processes and allows differentiation between one-electron transitions and cases where electron detachment is accompanied by further relaxation. In some cases, large degrees of orbtial relaxation may be interpretted as shake-up/down transitions or pseudo two-electron processes.
